# landing page
This project is about my landing page that is done with Html,Css and Javascript. I mainly used Javascript DOM manipulation to
the contents on the page.

## Table of content
*Html*
*Css*
*Javascript*

### Html
The html is use to make the page writing and also links the css and javascript
in order to help run the page smoothly.

#### Css
Css is use to create the style of the writing of the page.

#### Javascript
Almost all the work is done on the js by using the __document object model__ or *DOM* for
short in order to create the navbar section on the page with a click funtion.


##### Usage
In order to use the landing page file, you just need to have a **VS code editor** which you
will need to install node.js on your local computer for the js to run.

##### Installing Node

If you would like to take advantage of the live server and/or the tests, you must have node.js installed on your system.

To check if you already have Node.js installed, open your terminal application and run the following code:

```bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is installed, a version will be returned--something like `v16.14.2`.

If Node.js is not installed, you can install it from their website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Nodejs.org</a>. Make sure to select the **LTS**, "Recommended for most users," version.
If you follow all of the above instructions, it will fine for the landing page to run on your local machine.
